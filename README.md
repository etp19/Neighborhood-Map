#Detroit Neighborhood Map project
 

##Introduction:

This project is a interactive map from Detroit , MI and it contains locations in which I am interested and I have visited.
When you click on any of the markers it will display the location's name, a picture about the place, a phone number if available and 
a link to their official website, on the left there is a list that shows all places and it features a search box where you can dynamically filter the locations.
 
 
##Tools, languages and frameworks:

The app use JavaScript as it is main language and it also make use of jquery and knockout to follow a MVVM pattern. I use google material design lite framework for the css style giving the app a 
better feel and make it responsive in any device.
